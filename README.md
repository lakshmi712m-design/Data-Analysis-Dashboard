#Electrical-Vehicle-Analysis (Interactive Dashboard using Tableau)

##Project Objective

The goal of this project is to analyze the adoption and growth of Electric Vehicles (EVs) across the United States. The dashboard provides valuable insights such as EV distribution by state, growth trend by model year, top manufacturers and models, and the impact of CAFV (Clean Alternative Fuel Vehicle) eligibility. This analysis helps identify market trends and supports decision-making for EV stakeholders, policymakers, and manufacturers.
