#Electrical-Vehicle-Analysis (Interactive Dashboard using Tableau)

##Project Objective

The goal of this project is to analyze the adoption and growth of Electric Vehicles (EVs) across the United States. The dashboard provides valuable insights such as EV distribution by state, growth trend by model year, top manufacturers and models, and the impact of CAFV (Clean Alternative Fuel Vehicle) eligibility. This analysis helps identify market trends and supports decision-making for EV stakeholders, policymakers, and manufacturers.

##Dataset used
- <a href="https://github.com/lakshmi712m-design/Data-Analysis-Dashboard/blob/main/electricvehicledata.xlsx">Electric Vehicle Data</a>

##Questions (KPIs)

- Total number of electric vehicles in the U.S.

- What is the overall average electric range?

- What percentage of total EVs are BEVs vs PHEVs?

- EV distribution by Model Year (2010 onwards).

- Which states have the highest EV adoption?

- Which manufacturers (Make) contribute the most?

- What are the top 10 EV models in the market?

- What percentage of EVs are CAFV eligible?

- Dashboard Interaction <a href="https://github.com/lakshmi712m-design/Data-Analysis-Dashboard/blob/main/evanalysis.twbx"> View dashboard </a>

##Process

- Cleaned and validated the dataset to ensure accuracy by resolving missing and inconsistent values.

- Performed data processing to derive metrics related to EV type, range, model, CAFV eligibility, and geographical distribution.

- Built visualizations using Tableau including line chart, bar chart, map chart, donut chart, and tables.

- Integrated all visuals into a single interactive dashboard with slicers for:

 - State

 - CAFV Eligibility

 - EV Type (BEV / PHEV)

 - Model

##Project Insight

- BEVs constitute a larger share of EVs compared to PHEVs, indicating strong consumer preference for fully electric vehicles.

- EV adoption has increased exponentially since 2018, showing accelerated market growth.

- California leads in EV numbers among all states due to policy support, infrastructure, and consumer demand.

- Tesla dominates the EV market, followed by Nissan, Chevrolet, Ford, BMW and Kia.

- Model Y and Model 3 are the most popular EV models, reflecting strong brand trust and performance.

- More than 40% of vehicles are CAFV eligible, showing the positive influence of government incentives.

##Final Conclusion

The U.S. electric vehicle market has shown exceptional growth over the last decade, driven by technological advancements, competitive manufacturers, and favorable state policies. To continue accelerating EV adoption, expanding charging infrastructure and increasing CAFV eligibility incentives will play a crucial role. Manufacturers should focus on improving range efficiency and affordability, while policymakers can target high-potential regions to boost sustainable transportation.
